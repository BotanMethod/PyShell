# PyShell
**PyShell** - custom shell for executing commands on Windows 7+
It has extensive list of commands for work with system.

# Dependences
* Python 3.8+
  * Colorama
* Windows 7+

## Warning!
PyShell will not be able to run on systems that do not support the 'tree' command, you can delete this command in the source code yourself if you want to run PyShell at home. I'm not encouraging you to change the source code in any way if you don't understand programming, but just want to work in this shell.
